General Assembly in Tokyo, Japan, September 2024. This first part gives a gentle introduction to the working

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Tantalum capacitors
make up one of the five main capacitor dielectric types used in
modern electronic systems. The use of tantalum capacitors goes back
nearly one hundred years, but since the invention of the solid
tantalum capacitor at the beginning of the transistor age, the use of
tantalum capacitors in electronics has grown. This paper traces the
development and application of tantalum capacitors since that
invention. Since tantalum capacitors are still under development for
future applications, a final section discusses some of the current
directions and challenges for tantalum capacitors.</p>

Tantalum Capacitor</font></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The use of tantalum
capacitors goes back over 90 years when wet tantalum capacitors
(Figure 1) were introduced by Fansteel and Tansitor. The tantalum
capacitor is a polar device with tantalum metal as the positive
electrode (anode) and a wet electrolyte or a solid semiconductor as
the negative electrode (cathode) and tantalum pentoxide (Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>)
as the dielectric.</p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The wet tantalum
capacitor consists of a tantalum anode fabricated either from an
etched tantalum foil or sintered tantalum powder to which a tantalum
lead wire is attached for the anode contact. A dielectric film of
tantalum pentoxide (Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) is formed on the
anode electrochemically from an ionic solution (typically dilute
phosphoric acid). The electrolyte is usually sulfuric acid with some
additives to increase its viscosity. The cathode can be a high
surface area tantalum powder or a noble metal compound such as Pt or
RuO<sub>2</sub>. These are hermetically sealed in a can to which a
wire is attached for the cathode contact. In the past, silver cans
were used but today the can is tantalum (or sometimes titanium). When
they were introduced, wet tantalum capacitors were replacements for
aluminum electrolytic capacitors in some demanding applications
because of their smaller size and higher reliability. Wet tantalum
capacitors are capable of high bulk capacitance and high voltage
(125V) operation, but they suffer from high Equivalent Series
Resistance (ESR), high dependence of capacitance and ESR on
temperature, and are not very volumetrically efficient because of the
hardware needed to hermetically seal the capacitor. However, they are
still in use today primarily in military and medical applications.</p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The solid tantalum

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The wet electrolyte
is replaced with a conductive manganese dioxide (MnO<sub>2</sub>)
solid cathode (resistivity of about 0.1-1‚Ñ¶-cm) and contact of the
MnO<sub>2</sub> cathode is made via a graphite (carbon) and silver
layers. The purpose of graphite is to prevent reaction between the
MnO<sub>2</sub> and silver layers. In the thru-hole hermetic seal
version shown in Figure 2, the silver is soldered to a (brass) can
and a cathode lead is attached to the can. We‚Äôll see that later
developments replaced the solder, can, etc. with thinner layers that
made the overall capacitor more volumetrically efficient.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The tantalum
capacitor shares the overall capacitor market with several other
capacitor types. Other types having significant market share include
Film, Multilayer Ceramic (MLCC), Aluminum Electrolytic, and Super (or
Ultra) Capacitors. The principal reason to choose a tantalum
capacitor is the high capacitance times voltage product (CV, measured
in coulombs) that can be realized in a small package size, stable
capacitance with voltage and temperature, and high reliability.
Equation 1 shows the fundamental relationship between CV and the
properties of the Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> dielectric:</p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The principal way
that high capacitance is achieved in a tantalum capacitor is through
the area or A term in Equation 1. Figure 3 show a scanning electron
micrograph (SEM) of a capacitor grade tantalum powder. The primary
particle size of the powder is less than 1¬µm and surface area of the
powders used in recently introduced tantalum capacitors exceed 2m¬≤/g
which gives the tantalum capacitors their high capacitance.</p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">For a capacitor to
function it also needs to be reliable when energized in a circuit.
The Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> dielectric is an amorphous dielectric
capable of withstanding a high electric field (the V/d term in
Equation 1). The theoretical breakdown voltage of the Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>
dielectric is about 550 V/¬µm which is comparable to Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
and plastic film dielectrics and much higher than that crystalline
ceramics like barium titanate. In practice, the dielectric strength
is usually derated about 2 to 4x to achieve the rated voltage of the
capacitor.</p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Regarding
reliability, we‚Äôll return to this topic when we examine the
invention and development of the solid tantalum capacitor in the next

cathode semiconductor material.</p>

of the Solid Tantalum Capacitor</font></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The invention of the
solid tantalum capacitor with the manganese dioxide cathode has an
interesting history as it was invented by two different groups at
about the same time. One group was led by Dr. Preston Robinson
(Figure 4) at Sprague Electric located in the town of North Adams in
western Massachusetts, USA. In US Patent 3,066,247<a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote1anc" href="#sdendnote1sym"><sup>1</sup></a>
(applied for in 1954 and a continuation in part of a 1951
application) he describes a tantalum capacitor with a lead dioxide
cathode, but the claim is to a more general use of solid
semiconductive material. The key property of this semiconductive
material (Claim 1) is ‚Äúsaid semiconductive material being reducible
in the presence of high fields, said film-forming metal being
oxidizable upon reduction of said semiconductor material to heal
imperfections in said dielectric film‚Ä¶‚Äù.</p>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">This ‚Äúself-healing
mechanism‚Äù of certain metal oxides is one of the keys to the
reliability of the solid tantalum capacitor. No dielectric is
perfect: tantalum pentoxide will contain imperfections due to
impurities (metals, carbon, etc.), crystalline inclusions, oxygen
vacancies, and cracks due to manufacturing stresses. Figure 5 shows
one of the healing mechanisms. When the semiconductive MnO<sub>2</sub>
is heated it transforms to a non-conductive lower oxide (Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)
which forms a non-conductive ‚Äòplug‚Äô at the defect in the
dielectric at the defect site. The heating to effect this
transformation is provided by the leakage current flowing through the
small area of the defect site. When the transformation to the lower
manganese oxide occurs, oxygen can also be donated to the dielectric
which can neutralize defects such as oxygen vacancies.

and while the patents applications were submitted in the mid-1950‚Äôs,
by the early 1960‚Äôs the patents still hadn‚Äôt been issued due to
the dispute of priority of inventorship. By then the tantalum
